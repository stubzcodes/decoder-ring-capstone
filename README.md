# decoder-ring-capstone

Software Engineering Immersion capstone project that requires three different functions that can encode and deconde messages.

Caesar:
  encodes messages by shifting letters by a given positive or negative numbers

Polybius
  encodes messages by replacing with corresponding number from polybius square
  
Substitution
  encodes messages by replacing characters with corresponding characters from a new alphabet
  
There are students written tests for each of the functions as well.
